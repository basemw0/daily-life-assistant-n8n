# Daily Zekr, Calendar, Tasks & AI News - n8n Template

**A lightweight n8n workflow that sends you a single morning email containing:**

- ðŸ•Œ **Zekr of the Day** (from Google Sheets)  
- ðŸ“… **Today's Schedule** (Google Calendar â€” start & end times)  
- âœ… **Today's Tasks** (Todoist â€” cleaned and filtered)  
- ðŸ“° **Daily AI News Highlights** (aggregated from AI news sources)

This repository includes an importable n8n workflow JSON file and instructions to help you set it up quickly on your own n8n instance.

## Quick Start (Import into n8n)

1. **Import the workflow**  
   - In n8n, go to **Workflows â†’ Import** and upload the `workflow.json` file.  
   - Open the imported workflow in the editor.

2. **Connect your credentials**  
   - For every node requiring access (Google Sheets, Google Calendar, Todoist, Gmail, LLM, News API), click the node â†’ **Credentials** â†’ create or connect your account.  
   - Replace placeholders such as `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SHEET_ID` or API keys with your actual values.

3. **Prepare your Google Sheet**  
   - Create a Google Sheet with a header row containing at least the column:  
     - `zekr`  
   - Populate it with your azkar list (see dataset linked below).  
   - Note your Sheet ID from the URL.

4. **Configure nodes**  
   - **Google Sheets**: Set the Document to your sheet.  
   - **Google Calendar**: Select the calendar to fetch events from.  
   - **Todoist**: Connect your Todoist account.  
   - **News API or AI News Source**: Configure credentials and query parameters for AI news aggregation.  
   - **LLM / Formatter**: Add your API key or credentials if used.  
   - **Gmail (or SMTP)**: Set sending credentials and recipient email address.

5. **Test the workflow**  
   - Run individual nodes to verify data retrieval:  
     - Google Sheets: Azkar are fetched correctly.  
     - Google Calendar: Events have correct start and end times.  
     - Todoist: Tasks are filtered and cleaned as expected.  
     - News API: Confirm AI news articles are retrieved.  
   - Run the full workflow in dry-run mode or activate the Cron trigger to schedule daily emails.

## How It Works (High-Level Overview)

1. Cron trigger activates the workflow daily at a configured time.  
2. Google Sheets node reads your azkar list.  
3. Function node selects the **Zekr of the Day** based on the day or custom logic.  
4. Google Calendar node retrieves todayâ€™s events with start and end times.  
5. Todoist node fetches todayâ€™s tasks, with filtering applied.  
6. News API or AI news source node aggregates the latest AI news headlines.  
7. LLM or formatter node assembles a nicely formatted HTML email combining:  
   - Zekr of the Day  
   - Todayâ€™s events  
   - Todayâ€™s tasks  
   - AI news highlights  
8. Gmail node sends the email to your configured recipient.

## Customization Ideas

- Switch from email to WhatsApp messages using Twilio API.  
- Add text-to-speech audio of the Zekr attached to the email.  
- Integrate a personal assistant chatbot on Telegram for interactive daily briefings.  
- Extend news sources or tailor AI news topics according to your interests.
