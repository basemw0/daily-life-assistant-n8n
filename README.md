# Daily Zekr, Calendar & Tasks ‚Äî n8n Template

**A lightweight n8n workflow that sends a single morning email with:**
- üïå **Zekr of the Day** (from Google Sheets)
- üìÖ **Today's schedule** (Google Calendar ‚Äî start & end times)
- ‚úÖ **Today's tasks** (Todoist ‚Äî cleaned & filtered)

This repo contains an importable n8n workflow (JSON) and supporting instructions so you (or others) can plug it into your own n8n instance.

---

## Files in this repo
- `workflow.json` ‚Äî the exported n8n workflow (credentials removed; import into your n8n)
- `README.md` ‚Äî this file
- `screenshots/` ‚Äî sample email & workflow screenshots
- `LICENSE` ‚Äî project license (MIT)

## Quick start ( import into n8n )

1. **Import the workflow**
   - In n8n: click **Workflows ‚Üí Import** and upload `workflow.json`.
   - After importing, open the workflow editor.

2. **Connect your credentials**
   - For each node that needs a credential (Google Sheets, Google Calendar, Todoist, Gmail, LLM), click the node ‚Üí Credentials ‚Üí create/connect your account.
   - Replace any placeholder values like `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SHEET_ID`.

3. **Verify the Google Sheets structure**
   - Create a Google Sheet with a header row containing at least:
     - `zekr` (Arabic text)
     - `description` (optional short explanation)
   - Upload your azkar list there and note the Sheet ID.

4. **Configure the nodes**
   - Google Sheets node: set **Document** to your sheet and **Range** to the column (e.g., `A:A` or the sheet page).
   - Google Calendar node: choose the calendar to read from.
   - Todoist node: connect your Todoist account.
   - LLM / AI node: set your API key or credentials if using the formatter.
   - Gmail node (or SMTP): configure sending credentials and `To` address (your email).

5. **Test the workflow**
   - In the editor, run nodes individually to confirm data flows:
     - Run the Google Sheets node ‚Üí ensure the `zekr` and `description` appear.
     - Run Google Calendar ‚Üí verify events return start & end times.
     - Run Todoist ‚Üí ensure tasks are filtered (you may need to run the cleaning function).
   - Finally, run the full workflow (dry-run) or enable the Cron trigger for actual scheduled runs.

## Notes & security
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Remove secrets:** `workflow.json` has been sanitized, but always double-check for secrets before publishing.
- **Tokens & credentials** must be created by each user inside their own n8n instance.
- If you plan to distribute this widely, prefer using OAuth and instruct users to create their own API credentials.

## How it works (high level)
1. Cron trigger runs daily at configured time.
2. Google Sheets node reads the azkar list.
3. A function node picks the daily zekr (based on day-of-month or your chosen logic).
4. Google Calendar node retrieves today‚Äôs events (start & end time).
5. Todoist node retrieves today‚Äôs tasks (a Function node filters unwanted demo items).
6. An LLM/Formatter node constructs a nice HTML email (zekr + translation/description + events + tasks).
7. Gmail node sends the email (optionally attach a TTS MP3).

## Customization ideas
- Send via WhatsApp using Twilio instead of email.
- Add TTS audio of the Zekr and attach to the email.
- Multi-user onboarding (turn into a small service).
- Save sent emails in Google Drive or Notion for logging.
