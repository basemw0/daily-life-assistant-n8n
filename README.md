# Daily Zekr, Calendar & Tasks - n8n Template

**A lightweight n8n workflow that sends a single morning email with:**
- ðŸ•Œ **Zekr of the Day** (from Google Sheets)
- ðŸ“… **Today's schedule** (Google Calendar â€” start & end times)
- âœ… **Today's tasks** (Todoist â€” cleaned & filtered)

This repo contains an importable n8n workflow (JSON) and supporting instructions so you (or others) can plug it into your own n8n instance.

## Quick start ( import into n8n )

1. **Import the workflow**
   - In n8n: click **Workflows â†’ Import** and upload `workflow.json`.
   - After importing, open the workflow editor.

2. **Connect your credentials**
   - For each node that needs a credential (Google Sheets, Google Calendar, Todoist, Gmail, LLM), click the node â†’ Credentials â†’ create/connect your account.
   - Replace any placeholder values like `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SHEET_ID`.

3. **Verify the Google Sheets structure**
   - Create a Google Sheet with a header row containing at least:
     - `zekr` 
   - Upload your azkar list there and note the Sheet ID (You will find the list down)

4. **Configure the nodes**
   - Google Sheets node: set **Document** to your sheet.
   - Google Calendar node: choose the calendar to read from.
   - Todoist node: connect your Todoist account.
   - LLM / AI node: set your API key or credentials if using the formatter.
   - Gmail node (or SMTP): configure sending credentials and `To` address (your email).

5. **Test the workflow**
   - In the editor, run nodes individually to confirm data flows:
     - Run the Google Sheets node â†’ ensure the `zekr` appear.
     - Run Google Calendar â†’ verify events return start & end times.
     - Run Todoist â†’ ensure tasks are filtered (you may need to run the cleaning function).
   - Finally, run the full workflow (dry-run) or enable the Cron trigger for actual scheduled runs.

## How it works (high level)
1. Cron trigger runs daily at configured time.
2. Google Sheets node reads the azkar list.
3. A function node picks the daily zekr (based on day-of-month or your chosen logic).
4. Google Calendar node retrieves todayâ€™s events (start & end time).
5. Todoist node retrieves todayâ€™s tasks (a Function node filters unwanted demo items).
6. An LLM/Formatter node constructs a nice HTML email (zekr + translation/description + events + tasks).
7. Gmail node sends the email .

## Customization ideas
- Send via WhatsApp using Twilio instead of email.
- Add TTS audio of the Zekr and attach to the email.
- Add a personal Assistant Chatbot through telegram
